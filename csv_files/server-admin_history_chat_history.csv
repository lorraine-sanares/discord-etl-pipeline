Hey Admins and Mods! Starting June 18, you might notice members of your server bringing new fun, games, and functionality to your space with apps.

We launched a new feature that allows anyone to add apps to their own account, and use them across all of their servers, DMs, and GDMs.

Check out our [Help Center article](<https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/23957313048343>) to learn about how you can effectively moderate apps in your server, including:

- What these apps can (and can‚Äôt) do
- How to set up our new ‚Äú**Use External Apps‚Äù** permission, available now
- How we leveled up AutoMod to keep your server safe

Wanna spend some time tinkering? Follow our [guide to building your own app](<https://discord.com/developers/docs/tutorials/developing-a-user-installable-app>)!

Stay awesome,
The Discord Team"

üëÄ  What's that tag?

Hey Admins and Mods! Starting May 15, it's possible you might notice something new next to some of your members' usernames: ‚ú® **Guild Tags **‚ú®

See a cute little tag next to a member's username or profile? That's a **Guild Tag**, which indicates someone's membership to a chosen Guild. You can click on this tag to see the Guild profile, and even apply for membership there as well. What this means for you, beloved Admins and Mods, is that if your server's AutoMod is on, it will also check for Guild Tags ‚òëÔ∏è 

**What's a Guild?** It's a small, exclusive server that members can apply to join. These servers are tight-knit communities where members can relish in shared identities, hobbies, play styles, and more! 
> Please note that Guilds are only available to a small number of servers at this time, so not every server has access to this experiment. Additionally, our support team cannot manually add servers to this experiment.

Much love,
The Discord Team"
